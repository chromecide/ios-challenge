In order to be considered for the iOS position, you must complete the following steps. 

*Note: This task should take no longer than 1-2 hours.*


### Prerequisites

- Please note that this will require knowledge of [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [REST API's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). 

- You will need to have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.

## Task

1. Fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend).
2. Create a *source* folder to contain your code. 
3. In the *source* directory, please create an iOS app that accomplishes the following:
	- Connects to the [JSONPlaceholder API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
	- Retrieve a list of users from the following [endpoint](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
	- Create a view that lists the name, email and city of entries and adds an [icon](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/308461/accept_success_tick_icon) to the right side of any user's entry where the city matches either "McKenziehaven" or "South Christy".
	- [Click here](iostest.png) for a screenshot mock up of what the final product should look like with only a few entries.
	- Create a unit test that checks the icon set method works for appropriate entries.
4. Create a *bin* folder and include the app as an IPA file, this will be used to test the application on an iPhone 5 running iOS 9.0.2.
